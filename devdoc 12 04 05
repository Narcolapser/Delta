I thought I cleaned up my repo, but I appearently did not. SO I'm going to continue for now until I get back to my desktop. There are a few files on there I don't want to loose, so I need to get it cleaned up there first. 

Alpha 7 baby! 
Alpha 7: Create construct of "Scenes" as well as 3D objects which allow for objects to parent other objects. for example, follow cams. and lastly, get objects moving again. 

I'm going to do all those backwards! I'm going to figure out where I broke the ability to move objects.

I went to the "OnDisplay" function and uncommented the lines that said "setTrans" and then uncommented the uniform setting in the mesh's render function, and it worked just fine. Seems that what ever broke it a while ago was fixed in my Alpha 6 shinanigans. But it introduced some other comical problem, the transforms don't seem to be properly ordered and the sphere wouldn't transform with the rest of the world. xD The problem was that the global rotation transform wasn't getting passed. 

As I progress now into having parenting avaliable, I need to work on the ability for these local transforms to be calculated within the object itself.
