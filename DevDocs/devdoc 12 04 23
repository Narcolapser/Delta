August. That is my current projection for the completion of this project giving myself 1 week for each alpha (minus the mod5 alphas). That seems crazy intense, but so far, some of the things I thought would be really hard have been shockingly easy. Though not to mention, vice versa. But I've made great progress in the last few alphas, and today I start work on alpha 12, which will begin to give delta some semblance of a game engine. 

Today I begin working on the interface class and the trigger class. the interface class is the parent of all triggers and will replace delta's call backs for keyboarding and mouse movements. the trigger class will be described in the xml and will serve the purpose of allowing the UI to be defined in data. A trigger will act on its parent and has the following definition:
<parent>
	<Trigger action="action_name" event="event_name" argument="space seperated argument list"/>
</parent>

or specifically:
<Model path="sphere.obj>
	<Trigger action="move" event="key_a" argument="0 -1 0"/>
</Model>

This says that when i press the 'a' key, the model should be moved -1 on the global y axis. straight forward no?


I'm hitting an unfortunate problem: how do I know which method to call, and how do I send arguments that might be anything?

As a side note. Talking to John and reading some stuff on Wolfire gave me a dose of reality. I'm a fool to believe I could come anywhere near the capabilities of Physics libraries like ODE or Bullet. So for Delta I've decided to use the ODE library. This, by nature, forces me to give up on OpenCL. ODE doesn't support it. (Bullet does, but I'm waiting till Epsilon to use bullet so I can get familiar with physics engines with a less complicated engine first.) With no OpenCL that narrows the scope of this project significantly. So Cheers, here's to a shorter time developing maybe? back to coding. (well, actually, I'm off to band. maybe coding tonight, we shall see.)
