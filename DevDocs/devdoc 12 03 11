I'm on to alpha 5. I've decided that every 5th Alpha will be a cleaning period. Where in I prune unneeded code and document all the code. This alpha I've got the following objectives:

* write the readme - Done
* remake the make file - Done 
* Fix the mesh loading function - Done
* fix the mesh rendering function
* prune old scafolding code
* comment all the uncommented code (currently means the entire project. ^_^;)
* diagram current architecture.

First one is done. I'm probably going to be doing those in about that order too. So, off to learn about make!

Here's the tutorial i've foudn to use: http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/Tutor/Make/
It has helped me better than most. Make seems like one of those things that you either really get or don't. and It's never clicked for me. But I've recreated the make file to be more comprensive so I don't have to remove Delta before I recompile when I change one of its child files. 

Now the loading problem. I had decided to use realloc previously, but it has been giving me problems and I just hard coded the arrays to be 65535, not ok. So I'm just going to use vectors. its faster than what I'm currently doing. so it will have to suffice. 

The problem with the rendering function. really bizaar. put simply, an extra vert extends into infinity from the bottom left corner of an object and the center of the object. no clue... And now it appears to be gone. I didn't change anything. WTF! whatever, not going to complain.
