next question: when is the spawned object loaded. It makes good sense to have it loaded at load time. I currently don't have support for load time meshes, they are all models. Changing this would mean the ability to load resources that are then thrown into a limbo state of perhaps not getting used. It also begs the question, what about a mesh that is used? like the cube for example. the object that you are currently circling around in the Delta alpha is a cube. what if you shoot a cube? am I going to have to load them seperatly or can I some how make them share? haha! turly I can with no trouble at all. I have built-in to ResourceManager already the ability that should a request to load from the same path happen twice, the second time simply gets the ID of the original load. fancy pants!

Right now this system doesn't work, it actually just says that nothing has been loaded before, so my first order of business will be to fix that system. ... well dang. Turns out my little place holder function for the load system actually performed what the actual function is supposed to do. So this system is already fixed. fancy that.

So what this means is that the spawn even only has to care about what the path to the resource is, the resource manager will translate that into a UID for me. Because I can only put so much into an event's arguments and because I don't want to do a string comparison everytime i want to spawn. I'm going to have the mesh loaded at load time and when the events get loaded they will resolve the path to the UID and that value will be saved rather than the path.

Spawn events can be both internal and external. Right now they need to be registered to a parent object. If there isn't one to really parent it to, obviously the scene is the catch all. As certainly if there is no way for anything to really happen with out being part of a scene.
