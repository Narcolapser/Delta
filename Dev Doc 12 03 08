I've gotten the problem with the attrib, program, and camera solved. Huzzah! I've still not implemented the interface class. I'm pondering. I think I might rewrite that class because I out right forgot it even existed until i started this project over. I'm going to grow the class rather than design it and see if I can get a more suitable interface class that actually covers all my bases. But the next thing I want to do is replace the hard coded geometry with values read in from a file.
